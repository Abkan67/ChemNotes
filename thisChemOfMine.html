Nuclear Chem
Nuceleons are protons and nuetrons, which reside in the nucleus. The mass number is how many an atom has.
For each element, though, the atomic # (# of protons) is the same
Different isotopes are differentiated by their mass numebrs
Radionuclides are nuclei that are radioactive, and atoms that contain them are radioisotopes
An unstable nucleus can transform into a stable one with less energy by emitting radiation which carries that energy.
Alpha particlesare helium-4, and a stream of them is alpha radiation. Uranium -238 releases it.
It is called alpha decay or radioactive decay when it decomposes like this.
<sub>92</sub><sup>238</sup>U -->  <sub>90</sub><sup>234</sup>Th   +   <sub>2</sub><sup>4</sup>H
-It does not matter if it by itself or in a compound
Beta particles are high-speed electrons. they are represnrted by <sub>-1</sub><sup>0</sup>e
Superscript is 0 since electrons have little mass
subscript is -1 since elctrons have -1 charge.
So when I-131 undergoes Beta decay, it becomes Xe (but the atomic mass doesn't change)
Beta decay occurs ehrn a nuetron (<sub></sub><sup>1</sup>n) converts to a proton (<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>p)
Nuecleii do not normally contain electrons, only have them when this happens.
Gamma rays do not tend to be shown, as they are <sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup>y. They just transfer enegy.
Positrons are the same as electrons but with the opposite charge, (<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup>e)
Positron emmision converts a proton to a nuetron, which decreases the atomic number by 1.
Electron capture is when the nucleus captures one if its electrons and the atomic number decreases by 1.
    An electron is consumed to turn a proton into a nuetron.

<h1>Patterns of nucelar stability</h1>
Strong nuclear force keeps protons together.
<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>H is the only nucleii to have no proton.
Neutrons are needed to counteract protons and keep the nucleus together, but the more protons the exponentially mroe nuetrons. 
<b>All nuclei atomic number 84 or more are radioactive</b>
1-Nuclei with too many neutrons tend to emit beta (electron)
2-Nuclei with too little neutrons can do either positron emmission or electron capture.
3- If they have more han 83 protons, they do alpha emmisions, which reduces the protons and neutrons by 2.

<h3> Magic numbers </h3>:  nuclei with these amounts of nucleons are more stable
Protons : 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82
Neutrons: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126
Also if the number of protons and of nuetrons are both even, not odd, the nucleus tends to be more stable.
<i> Shell model of the nucleus</i> claims that nucleons fit together like electrons in a shell, which is supported by the observation of magic numebrs

<h3>Radioactive series</h3> or nuclear disitigration series is a series of nuclear reactions that begins with an unstable nuclues and terminates with a stable one.
Three occur in nature
1: From Uranium-238 -> lead-206
2: From Uranium-235 -> lead-207
3: from Thorium-232 -> lead-208




<h1>Nuclear transmutations</h1> 
are brought about when a nucleus is struck by a neutron or other nucleus.
In 1914, Ernst Rutherford converted Nitrogen-14 into Oxygen-17 and 1 proton by shooting it with alpha particles from radium.
     -This proved that alpha particles can change nucleii, not just spontaneous reactions.
Taxonomicall, the transmutation is sometimes written as 'the target nucleus, bombarding particle, ejected particle, and product nucleus'.
      So <sub>7</sub><sup>14</sup>N  +  <sub>2</sub><sup>4</sup>He -->  <sub>8</sub><sup>17</sup>O  +  <sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>H
          would be written as: <sub>7</sub><sup>14</sup>N(a, p)<sub>8</sub><sup>17</sup>O
Particle accelators speed up these particles to fast enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them and the target nucleus.
     Cyclotrons use magnets to keep the particles moving while dees alternate positive and negative chanrge which push the particles around to make them go really fast.
<i> Neutrons do not need to be accelerated </i> as they have no charge and are not electrostatically repelled.

<h3> Transuranium elements</h3> are elecments synthesized through transmutations, they have have an atomic number above 92.



<h1> Rates of Radioactive Decay</h1>
Radioactive materials that decay very quickly ar enot found naturally. Uranium-238 dcays incredibly slowly and is found naturally.
They have a characteristic first-order half-life
     Weirdly, these stay unaffected by all external conditions
<b> Carbon Dating </b> works bc Carbon-14 is radioactive (half life is 5715 years) and carbon-12 is not. WHile alive, an animal has constant amounts of both, which are the same proprtions as in the atmoshpere, 
but once dead it doesn't replenish the carbon-14. So finding the carbon-14 to carbon-12 ratio tells how long since it died, up to 50,000yr.
Rate = kN, where k is the decay constant and N is the amount of rasioactive nuclei.
Bequerels (Bq) are used as SI for how much it decays (activity).
ln(N<sub>t</sub>/N<sub>0</sub>) = -kt
so k = 0.693/(half-life)



<h1> Detection of radioactivity</h1>
Can be done with a <i> Geiger counter</i> which takes in ionizing radiation and meaures the current produced whenever ionizing radiation enters.
Film plates and photographic plates darken to meausre one's exposure to radioactivity
Phospors are atoms that emit light when hit with certain radiation, and they are meausred with a scintillation counter
<h5>Radiotracers</h5>
When a radioactive isotope is mixed with other ones they have similar properties and go through the same reactions. 
Radiotracers are the radioavtive ones and they are meausred to see the progression of a reaction.

<h1> Energy changes in nuclear reactions </h1>
<h4>E(kg)=m(j)cc</h4>
Energy and mass are proportional, if one dcreases the other also decreases. Small losses of mass lose large amounts of  energy.
Most nuclear reactions actually have a net loss in mass, so they are highly exothermic.

This indicates that nuclei with intermediate mass numbers ar emor eitghtly bound. Anything above <sup>54</sup>Fe will fission and anything below will release <i>much</i> more energy through fusion.


<h1> Fission</h1>
When a nuetron hits a heavy nucleus it can break up the strong force for long enough for the nucleus to split.
     This process can release mroe nuetrons which together can all cause a <b>chain reaction</b> of fission.
	Uraium238 releases about 2.4 nuetrons per breakage
<h5>Critical Mass</h5>
-If there is too few nuclei, then the nuetrons will not hit the other ones and they will escape from the sample.
-At critical mass, each nuetron produces at least one mor enuetron on average
-Anything past that is supercritical, the more there is the less neutrons escape which could cause an explosion


<h2>Ractors</h2>
<i>I'm good with nuclear reactors</i>
To manage waste, they used to put it in a reporcessing site where they would sepreate out the fuel from the waste that was makign the reactor innefieicneint, but that failed
   So nowthey just store it on site.




<h1>Fusion</h1>
FUsion is cooler bc if you get energy from fusing two lighter nucleii it is probab;y npt radioactive and makes more enrgy also the reactants are more abundant.
It needs a lot of energy from temp, through
    the coldest possible is deuterium (<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H) and tritium (<sup>3</sup><sub>1</sub>H), which needs 40,000,000 K

<i>Tokamak</i>s are the hot new idea to do it and they use magnetic fields.
So far, only the sun can do it sucessfully



<h1>Biology</h1>
Ionizing radiation has mroe enrgy and is more dangerous than nonionizing radiation
